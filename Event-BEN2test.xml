Ideas for new character.
NPC Flat chested woman
She likes to abuse bigh breasted woman. You meet her somewhere if you have a big breasted slave.
She is a cruel dominatrix filled with envy.
You can sell a slave to her, if done so the slave will suffer and you get to know her better. 
If you visit her you can try to gain knowlead of her, but will be tortured and dominated in return. If you fall to low you can get a bad end.
After knowing enouth, you can propose a breast enlargement treatment to her. She suggest a time limit in which you have to reach her desired breast size or she will claim that you are a fraud in front of the court. If accepted you have to start her treatment.
During treat ment sessions she keeps tormenting you and reducing your dominance. The treatment also reduces her dominance. When the treat ment gets toward the end, you start dominating her and your dominance rises.
On a certain size the treatment gets stuck and you need to start drugging her(secretly) as to achive the result in the timeframe. From this point on she gets a milder temprament.
If you start BDSM training and humiliation on her then you can get her to become submissive. Ending with her selling herself into becomming a public slave to be as much tormentd and tortured as possible(the max M). If you drug her a lot she becomes dumm enouth to be unable to think properly, there you can make her sign a disfarced slavery contract as if she where selling some stuff and was actually selling herself. This will lead her to become a cow in your barn. Maybe I should write this as an extension of the SMencounter event.

                    When you wake up and head for the kitchen, you see Adisa already preparing breakfast for you and your slaves. 
                    To your delight, you manage to see Adisa as she is finishing squeezing her right breast firmly moaning in the process. You watch as she slowly leaks milk in a glass that is getting full. \r
                    You feel aroused as Adisa cleans her nipple from her dripping milk with her fingers, taking each finger and licking it fully clean. Adisa turns around and sees you as you stand there smiling to her. She smiles back and without saying anything she starts walking towards you with the glass in her hand and gives it to you.\r
                    You take the glass and gladly lift it to your lips, as you first smell the milk. There is nothing better than the smell of freshly milked milk. You take a sip and the milk slowly runs down your throat with a cream like thickness. \r
                    You finish the glass enjoying each sip and leave Adisa so proud, as you head into the day fully fed from her milk.

                    You decide to talk to Adisa about the café and she seems to be quite interested in it but a little scared as well due to former days from when she was a slave.
                    While lost in thought about the café you start rubbing Adisa's breasts until her nipples are hard once again so you can work on pinching her nipples and pulling them down. After a little milk starts dripping you change to sucking her nipples to get your daily milk directly from the source. Soon Adisa goes "moohing" and you start to play around a bit with her udders, squeezing more and more her big firm breasts until without a warning she hits orgasm. This results in milk pouring out of her breasts all over the floor and table and some slaves that were in the way, accidentally got covered in thick delicious milk as well.

                    Once you wake up you hear a knock on your door. To your surprise, it is the manager of the café you have been visiting.                    He thanks you for the help you provided yesterday and tells you that the maids and customers really appreciated what you did for them. You invite him in and order #slave to bring some milk for both of you. The manager talks about the milk and maid shortage for a while before #slave brings the milk you ordered. He takes a sip and immediately looks up with a surprise on his face.                    The manager asks you where this delicious milk comes from and you tell the manager about Adisa. He asks to see Adisa and you decide to allow him to meet her and ask #slave to send in Adisa.
                    
                    As Adisa enters the room, his eyes seem to jump out of his skull onto her enormous breast. Once the manager regained composure, he asks you to let her work for him at the café.

                    You decide to take a break at a café in the Town Center. To your surprise, the maid serving you has big breasts. Not just big but so big that you are surprised that the top she is wearing is capable of holding them inside. It is clear that these breasts are full of delicious milk and you quickly get the taste back from Adisa's milk into your mouth. \r
                    The maid takes your order and once she asks what you want drink all you are thinking about is how much you wish you could taste her milk. You start to imagine how her milk would taste compared to Adisa's milk. \r
                    The maid interrupts your thoughts by asking you again what you want to drink and without thinking you say "Fresh milk please". Realizing that you had just stared at her breasts the entire time, while you said that you immediately start to flush.

You still ask for milk like before but this one only writes it down in the book and leaves. Less than a minute later, she returns with a glass of milk to you. You taste it and realize that this is just normal milk.

                    The maid smiles broadly and giggles while saying "Coming right up" and as soon as she says that, she puts down her notebook and pencil, pulls down her shirt so her breasts bounce free from the unneeded clothing. She then reaches for your glass and starts rubbing her breasts right in front of you, until her milk, her white delicious thick milk, starts pouring out of her nipples into your glass.                     Slowly the glass fills up and you can hear her moan while she is rubbing her breast, squeezing the milk out. After the glass is full, she puts it in front of you, picks up a towel, cleans herself up and fixes her shirt back to hide these large breasts of hers.\r
                    You are quite surprised by the maids reaction but yet glad to be able to taste her milk. 
                    As you smell the milk before you drink it, you realize that the milk smells less mature than Adisa's milk. With the first sip, you can taste the milk. It is creamy but not as much as Adisa's and while it is incredibly good, you can't stop but notice that it is not as satisfying as a whole meal itself.
                    Also it seems more watery than you are used to from Adisa. This maid is clearly not as experienced as Adisa, but you definitely see a talent there.\r\r
                    After finishing the milk you pay the bill, while thinking about returning soon. This milk may not be the best you have tasted but there is certainly the potential and you do not want to miss that.

                                        You talk to Adisa about providing milk for you and your slaves in exchange for a roof over her head. She gladly accepts the offer, grabs some buckets and heads for the toilet. 

                                        You can hear her moaning through the door and once she is finished you tell her that she does not have to be so shy about her milking. 
                                        She thanks you and gives you a bottle of her newly milked milk.

                                        Yes, I plan to do loli slave or event some day. Also, expect a lot of fun events for the newly introduced island, as long as I get cmac to change the island image, because I didn't take care and did make the events for a different island shape. However, expect the beta only in January.

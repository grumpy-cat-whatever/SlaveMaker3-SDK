91  Did fail to rescue the villagers, because too much time passed
92  Did fail to rescue the villagers, because did lose in combat (bad end off)
93  Did fail to rescue the villagers, because did lose in combat, and expulsed from village because they lost even more members in the attemp since you convinced them to aid you (bad end off)
11  Did succeed in saving the villagers (abilitates the exploring of the caves)
12  Did get a wedding offer from one or more tribes people (figure some fancy way out to get the point sistem workin, but wait until you did write up to this part) (if I have enouth images for a minor loli slave I might make the tribal rules to only apply to already adult members of the tribe) (maybe the rule is that the wives have to stay in the tribe, so if you are female and marry a male, futa or more dominant female you will be forced to stay at the village, and have to try to escape if you want to get away.(Happy Bad End))

Tanned Elfen story line start

	1 Meet Leaf Elf

	2 Day 1-4 Search but don’t find elf

	3 Day 5+ Meet Tanned Leaf Elf
	
	4 Yao shows you tribal mechant 
	(time point: before making contact with tribe)

	5 Leads to naked encounters

	6 Find her part timing as maid, help her change after she spills something on her, sex. Or force her to work with only an apron for the rest of the day
	  
	7 Role play as slave and master because she finds it interesting
	  
	8 In the jungle you meet a real dark elf fleeing from a monster which had captured her.
	  
	9 Help defeat the monster, then fuck her
	  
	10 ntroduce the dark elf to Yao, and get her to take care of the girl, Yao fucks her
	  
	11 Random events of you meeting them on the beach, with a bit of sex.
	  
	(time point: after making contact with tribe and saving or not saving villagers)  
	12 Later when you talk to yao that you are permitted to go to the tribe she begs you to take her with you, if you know the other dark elf girl she will get dragged along. 
	  
	13 It look as if you come to the right time for a festival. Maybe of fertility.
	There is a nice party going on and she/they get drunk and start engaiging to the tribes man. They are about to marry into the tribe when youo get a choice to warn them. If you ignore it a battle between some tribes man starts, you can take part and save them so or just watch. They get married of to the victor of the battle. Unknowing to them, the married woman of the tribe aren’t permitted to leave the tribe. (Put in that one of the girls serving has pale skin with bound marks and is sobbing, looking worried over to the two dark elfes)
	  
	14a If they married a tribes man
		Now the nextt day when they try to leave they aren't permitted and start to realize that they are stuck. In panic they try to appeal to you. Since they are already married you can't do anything, so you can only watch as they are dragged back into the tent.

		On next visits to the tribe you see her/them bond and being trained/fucked to accept the tribal rules.

		After some months you see them pregnant and later with children and pregnant again, having resingned to their new lives.
	14b If you married them
	  Since they married under tribal rules they have to abide the tribal costumes, but 
	     - you can decide to argue(conversation check) that they belong to your tribe and therefore have to leave with you. 
	     - you can help them escape
	     - you can live their and train them to accept their new live (Happy end for you, bad end for them)
	     - you can ask the help of the villagers to train them in the tribal costumes. (bad end for them)
	           - later if you come again you see them trained, but never pregnant unless you fuck them, since they are your wives and the tribes men respect this
	     - you can introduce the concept of givting the girls to the whole village for reliev of the youngsters and old. (quite the bad end for them)
	           - later you can visit, fuck them. They are always pregnant, covert in cum and bound
	15 if they married noone because you warned them, then you can have another set of thank you sex and random encounters with Yao or both, but you if you did not meet the other elfen girl before going with yao to the tribe, you can meet her anymore and it is assumed that the monster recaptured her. (maybe in one of the cave explorations you can find her, but she will be broken and the girls you find you leave in care of the tribes men, since they are the only society and taking them with home would be problematic since they need care(they are broken in mind) The tribes people accept to take care of them and make their own human livestock with them. You may also end up there if you are defeted by a monster and "if chance" send you there. If bad ends are disabled they will take care of you for a while until you recover making you lose time in the process and having a lot of problems if you get back to mioya)

					While swimming on the beach you spot a beautiful elf wearing a quite risky leaf bikini. You ask yourself how it stays in place. Your stares are noticed by her and seem to make her flustered. Not wasting time to fill your curiosity you try to start a conversation with her.

					After some time she appears quite talkative, introducing herself as <b>Yao Ro Dushi</b>, even if blushing at your question about her swimsuit. 
					She tells that she got here also only today and did buy it from one of the local tribes people who seem to come to the beach to trade with the turist.

					Later when you part ways, she asks you to come talk to her if you visit the beach again since she will be staying her for quite some while.

It seems she rested to close to a plant of the tentacle family, as shown by her pitful state. Much to Yao's anger you stand back and watch the vines teasing her asshole.

Not minding the gazes her gliserning, Her in sweat covered body with firm exposed breast, spread legs in the air and invitaiting pussy atracts the gazes of the entire bar, but Yao doesn't seem to mind.(Check if exibiscionist you may also strip) You feel as your presence is all that keeps the situation from escalating.(Check Lust if you try to fuck her(may end in orgy), and dominace/charisma if you don't get a "its to hot" answer) (Also you check if you are female or futa and submissive, you can't resist the pressure of the gazes, Intimidated you undress and lay down besides Yao spreading your legs, ends in rape orgy.  If you are male you get frigthened and go back outside into the sun, soon after you her Yao screaming in anger as some men seem to bee holdiing her down and are grabing her all over her body, as you sweat in the sun soon her screams change into moaning and yelps. As the sun is almost setting the sounds of fucking end, you go look for Yao finding her blanked out, her holes gaping and releasing a constant stream of cum.

Then you realize that your spear is sticking in at an rather plain looking mount besides the plants. Imediatly they start to retreat towards the mount to shield it. It seems their real body was there in the mount. Taking this chance you run... and run until you end up at the beach, where you just fall into the sand and sleep.</SetText>

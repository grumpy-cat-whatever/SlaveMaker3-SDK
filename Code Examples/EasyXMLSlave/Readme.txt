How to make an XML slave easily?

Step One:
Put all the image files you have of your character in the same folder (no matter its name).
Open in two separated windows this folder and the folder '[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME]' in 'Images'.
Make sure there are only JPEGs with extension '.jpg' (not '.jpeg'), PNGs with '.png' and Shockwave Flash Objects with '.swf'.
Else they will not work.

Step Two:
Sort the images of your char putting them in the folder which name matches the utility of the image.
Simply use the click&drag.
Do not put several images in the folders listed in 'Only One Image!.txt'.

Step Three:
Open 'Rename.xls'.
Copy the address of the '[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME]' folder and paste it in the small dialogue box of the 'Rename.xls'.
Click 'Rename'.
Once it has finished, click 'Close'.

Step Four:
In the '[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME]' folder, use Windows Search to find all of the '*.jpg' files.
Copy them into the '[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME]' folder.
Repeat the operation for '*.png'.
Doing this, remove the nuber from the name of all images listed in 'Only One Image!.txt'.

Step Five:
Put the image for the Slave Market in the folder 'Slaves' and rename it into 'Slave-' immediately followed by your slave's name.

Step Six:
Fill up the 'Slave-[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME].xml' with the characteristics of your new slave.

Step Seven:
In 'SlaveGirlxx.txt', replace '[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME]' with the same of your slave and '[YOUR_SLAVES_DESC]' with a short description of your slave.
This description will be displayed in the Slave Market.

Step Eigth:
Rename the '[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME]' folder matching your char's name.
In the 'Slaves' folder, replace '[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME]' of 'Slave-[YOUR_SLAVES_NAME].xml' as above.
Replace 'xx' with a number that is one more than the total nuber of slaves published.
NB:This step can be done at any time, but before final step.

Final Step:
Put the folder 'Images' and 'Slaves into a compressed file (7z, zip, rar...)
Then publish it on http://www.futanaripalace.com/forumdisplay.php?215-Slave-Maker
